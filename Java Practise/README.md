**Object Oriented Programming**
=======

	Is a methodology to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance.


-   Object

-   Class

-   Inheritance

-   Polymorphism

-   Abstraction

-   Encapsulation

**Object**

An object is defined as an instance of class. An entity that has state
and behaviour is known as Object. Object contains an address and takes
up some memory in space.

**Class**

Collection of object and Methods are known as class. Class doesn't
consume Space.

**Inheritance**

When one object inherits all the properties and behaviour of parent
class then it's known as Inheritance. It provides code reusability and
to achieve polymorphism.

**Polymorphism**

If one task is performed in different ways then it's known as
polymorphism.

**Abstraction**

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as
abstraction. For example, Messages, we don\'t know the internal
processing. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve
abstraction.

**Encapsulation-Wrapper Class**

Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are
known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with
different medicines. A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java
bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are
private here.
